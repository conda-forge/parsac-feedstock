  summary: 'Parallel Sensitivity Analysis and Calibration'
  description: |
    parsac is a Python-based tool for sensitivity analysis and auto-calibration in parallel.
    It is designed for analysis of models that take significant time to run. For that reason,
    it focuses on storing and exploiting every single model result, and performing model
    runs in parallel on either a single machine or on computer clusters. It works with
    models that are run by calling one binary, that use YAML-based configuration files
    and that write their output to NetCDF.
